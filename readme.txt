main.py and can be run to get all the results of part1 and part2.

part1 performs edge detection of cameraman, edge detection of cameraman using DoG, straightening of all the files in
'straighten/', sharpens the taj (may change the image name to use a different image), then performs
blurring and sharpening of snail.png.

part2 performs the image hybrid of kitten and puppy.png (can be changed in the file),
gaussian and laplacian stack of lincoln.png, and multiresolution blending of bowser.jpeg and tesla.jpg.

Outputs of all parts are shown using skio.imshow, and saved to the current directory.
Previously saved outputs are all in the outputs directory in {function}_output folders.
